<p>It&rsquo;s just Jon, without the h.</p>

<h3 id="-the-destination-">| The Destination |</h3>
<p>Being a creator in the cyber realm and working with technology is what I always wanted to do but in order to get to where I am now, I had to walk through varying challenges first. Part of me would have loved to have a streamlined destination to this end zone that Iâ€™m at now. I could have saved myself a lot of headaches and hard work. But looking back, I had to go through all my work experiences as it has made me a better developer, engineer, leader, and person in general. It may not make sense to everyone, it may not be the familiar path that most developers go down, but I went down this path for a reason. It made me stronger, smarter, and I grew in perseverance and resilience. I would do it a million times over because it ultimately led me to here.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-the-adventure-">| The Adventure |</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Someone who really wants to get in a little over his head and make a dent in the universe.&rdquo; - Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote from the late and greatly missed Steve Jobs has been something I have always related to and find myself fulfilling through all of life&rsquo;s endeavors.</p>
<p>My journey is unlike any other. Growing up with my grandmother I was a quiet kid who followed directions and never had trouble with school. In high school I had many interests and thought my life could go in many different directions; engineer, entrepreneur, architect, chef, and the list goes on. Oh boy, I was right in the fact that my life would be unique.</p>
<p>I won the first full-tuition scholarship to attend Scottsdale Culinary Institute in a state-wide competition in Arizona. I graduated with my culinary degree. I was a chef and pastry chef at 4 star restaurants. But I was not satisfied and knew I was meant to do more.</p>
<p>I went back to school for business. I attended nationally top ranked Entrepreneurship and Business Management programs at the University of Arizona where I double majored. I was a General Manager and things were good, but too easy. Again, I was not satisfied and knew I was meant to do more.</p>
<p>God called me into the military and I enlisted in the U.S. Army as an Information Technology Specialist. I had always tinkered around with gadgets; like tube televisions, gameboys, pagers, POTS phones, and so on&hellip; I thought this was something that should be more than a hobby. I instantly excelled, deployed, lead soldiers, and gained many technical certifications. I switched from a soldier to an officer. I was selected to the Cyber Corps, and learned even more. Then I became a developer and certified as a Cyberspace Capabilities Developer. That is where I finally felt I was doing what I was called to do all along.</p>
<p>Being in cyber as a developer is a culmination of everything I enjoy doing and learning. I have found my passion on this earth and after being called to transition out of the military I took my talents to the civilian world to develop solutions to real world problems.</p>
<p>Now here I am, poised to &ldquo;make a dent in the universe&rdquo;.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="-the-family-">| The Family |</h3>
<p>My family is my heart and soul. I have a &ldquo;way out of my league&rdquo; wife whom we share four perfect children together. To round out our home we have wild little Yorkies. We are a big family that has lots of love, support, and talents to share with others. We are firm in our faith and wish nothing more than to make a positive impact on the world on those whom we are blessed enough to encounter on this journey.</p>
<hr>
<p>In closing, the Bible says it best as this is what I inspire to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In Jerusalem, he made machines designed by skillful men for use on the towers and on the corner defenses to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful.&rdquo; - 2 Chronicles | 26:15 | NIV</p>
</blockquote>
